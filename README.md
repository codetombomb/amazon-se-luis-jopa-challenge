# Phase 1 Code Challenge

You will have 24 hours after this message to complete this code challenge and submit it. The timer has started now.

## Project Setup. 
First, create an HTML webpage that is connected to a JavaScript file. CSS Styling is **not** optional, although good styling IS optional. 

With regard to your CSS, the intention of this code challenge is that you demonstrate an understanding of linking CSS to your HTML and, if relevant, your JavaScript. 

Furthermore, the larger purpose of this challenge is for you to demonstrate a clear understanding of how JavaScript, unassisted by libraries such as jQuery or React, manipulates the DOM. For this reason, for any of the deliverables below, it is imperative you **do not use `.innerHTML`**. 

### Deliverables
Your HTML file must have the following elements and event listeners:
  1. a **button** that will display an element on screen when clicked. 
  2. the newly displayed element should have a location (such as a new button) that will allow the user to hide it again, i.e. a way to close the new element. It is not important how you choose to hide the element, e.g. `opacity: 0`, `display: none`, `element.remove()`)
  3. Your HTML file must include an image somewhere. It can be hard-coded, or you can generate it with (1). Attach an event listener to this image that will place the image in fullscreen mode when it is double-clicked. (BIG HINT: Don't use CSS for this. We are asking for a specific **method** for JavaScript in the browser. You have encountered neither the double-click event nor this method through Flatiron materials.)
