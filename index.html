    <p>First, create an HTML webpage that is connected to a JavaScript file. CSS Styling is <strong>not</strong>
        optional, although good styling IS optional.</p>
    <p>With regard to your CSS, the intention of this code challenge is that you demonstrate an understanding of linking
        CSS to your HTML and, if relevant, your JavaScript.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the larger purpose of this challenge is for you to demonstrate a clear understanding of how
        JavaScript, unassisted by libraries such as jQuery or React, manipulates the DOM. For this reason, for any of
        the deliverables below, it is imperative you <strong>do not use <code>.innerHTML</code></strong>.</p>
    <h3 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h3>
    <p>Your HTML file must have the following elements and event listeners: 1. a <strong>button</strong> that will
        display an element on screen when clicked. 2. the newly displayed element should have a location (such as a new
        button) that will allow the user to hide it again, i.e. a way to close the new element. It is not important how
        you choose to hide the element, e.g. <code>opacity: 0</code>, <code>display: none</code>,
        <code>element.remove()</code>) 3. Your HTML file must include an image somewhere. It can be hard-coded, or you
        can generate it with (1). Attach an event listener to this image that will place the image in fullscreen mode
        when it is double-clicked. (BIG HINT: Don’t use CSS for this. We are asking for a specific
        <strong>method</strong> for JavaScript in the browser. You have encountered neither the double-click event nor
        this method through Flatiron materials.)
